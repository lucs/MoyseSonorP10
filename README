FIXME This file needs work, a lot of it.

Marcel Moyse, "De la sonorité, art et technique".

This project rewrites the second exercise, starting on page 10,
extending the range of permissible notes from B3 to C♯5, and presents
all the three notes possibilities in a more mixed up order, to respect
my ABC work practice (Always Be Changing).

The Makefile has three targets to build three files, which will be
placed in a subdirectory, called "gen" and created if necessary, of
the directory where the Makefile resides. The targets are:

    txt: Builds ./gen/moyse_sonor_p10.txt

    txtpdf: Builds ./gen/moyse_sonor_p10.txt.pdf

    ly: Builds a score, ./gen/moyse_sonor_p10.ly.pdf
